## Welcome

Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It’s based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.

Hyde is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server. See the Poole usage guidelines for how to install and use Jekyll.

Hyde includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.

```py
class SampleClass:
    def sample_function(person):
        print(f"Hello {person}!")

```

## Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by @mdo. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

- Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, RSS feed, posts, and example page)
- Mobile friendly design and development
- Easily scalable text and component sizing with rem units in the CSS
- Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
- Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
- Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

- Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
- Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and reverse (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
- Eight optional color schemes, available via `<body>` classes

## Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.
